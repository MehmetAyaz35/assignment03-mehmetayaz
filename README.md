# Hotel App Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains the configuration and implementation files for the HotelAppPipeline project. The main components of this project include a pipeline definition, TypeScript files for various pages (like dashboard, bills, etc.), and a test suite. This README will guide you through the purpose and contents of the .yml configuration file and how it integrates with the rest of the system.

## YML Configuration File
 **hotelAppPipeline.yml**

 This .yml file defines the CI/CD pipeline for the HotelApp. It is primarily used to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Below are the key components of the .yml file:

- Build Steps: The steps involved in building the application.
- Testing: Configuration for running automated tests using Playwright.
- Deployment: How and where the application is deployed after successful tests.

The YML file ensures a smooth workflow by integrating with a CI tool (such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI) and defining the tasks to be executed on every push or pull request.

To run these tests, ensure the following:
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Docker installed for running the test application.
- Environment variables managed via `.env` file.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MehmetAyaz35/assignment03-mehmetayaz.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd assignment03-mehmetayaz
    ```
3. **Install project dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
    ```
4. **Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content**:

   ```bash
   BASE_URL_API=http://localhost:3000/api
   BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/
   TEST_USERNAME=tester01
   TEST_PASSWORD=GteteqbQQgSr88SwNExUQv2ydb7xuf8c
    ```
 
## Adding Secrets to GitHub

To securely manage sensitive data like API keys or passwords, these values should be stored as GitHub Secrets. Hereâ€™s how you can add secrets and access them in your pipeline's environment:

**Steps to Add Secrets:**
1. Go to your repository's Settings tab on GitHub.
2. In the left sidebar, click on Secrets and variables under the Actions section.
3. Click New repository secret.
4. Enter a Name for your secret (e.g., TEST_USERNAME) and the corresponding Value (e.g., tester01).
5. Click Add secret to save it.

**Using Secrets in GitHub Actions**
Once your secret is added, you can access it in your GitHub Actions workflow by referencing it in the env section of the .yml file:
```bash
env:
  API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TEST_USERNAME }}
```

This makes your secret accessible as an environment variable within your workflow, while keeping it secure and out of version control.
